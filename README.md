## Purpose and Target Audience

The portfolio website is intended for attracting engagement from future employers as it shows my background, projects and technical ability. It also showcases the contents learned from weeks 1 to 3. As my technical capabilities grow, there will be more functionality and features added to this website.

## Functionality and Features

The website is designed in a way, where it is completely semantic, responsive amongst all devices and accessible to a diverse range of viewers. The design scheme is minimal, subtle and meaningful in a way where it draws the viewers to the content conveyed, rather than distract them. There are four pages featured:

- Home: Landing page, displaying my name, position and navigation as well as social links. Design wise,  this page is to be a place for the viewers to land, then navigate without distractions The content and its animations are subtle and carefully orchestrated to ensure focus on the navigation.
- About: This page focuses on information about me, profile image, links, and CV. All displayed in a way to ensure readability.
- Projects: Page to showcase my current and future projects, for future employers to be able to see my skillset and interests in terms of technology.
- Blogs: This page links to 5 additional blogposts, this is a personal blog, a series of reflections of chapters throughout my life.

All pages can navigate amongst each other seamlessly. The design scheme remains consistent across all the pages, with minimal design, slower, subtle animations all designed to relax the viewer and allow them to engage with the content.

## Sitemap

The site integrates all its pages, all pages can be accessed from any page within the site.
