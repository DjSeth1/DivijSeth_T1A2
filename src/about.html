            <h1 class="h2-styling">Hi there!</h1>
            <div class="small-text"> My name is Divij Seth, I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer. I am passionate about problem solving and learning new technologies to create exciting things that make everyone's daily lives a little better.</div>
            <h3>Why Programming?</h3>
            <div class="small-text">Well like many, programming was something that seemed like a far-fetched goal, it seemed like it was only meant for a certain minded individuals. Upon learning, that programming is all about problem solving, and it is as creative as it is logical, I dove right in, and haven't looked back since.</div>
            <h3>What Lead Me Here?</h3>
            <div class="small-text">My previous work experience was in teaching English across China and South East Asia from 2019 to 2022 (yes, I was at ground zero when Covid-19 started). While I enjoyed my travels, and work, I felt as if I had stopped learning new things and being challenged. I strive on continuous learning and growth, and decided to end my chapter there. Whilst working as a teacher I decided to learn basic Front-end technologies by myself, and after commitng many week nights and weekends coding, I decided this career change was the right move. So I gathered my belongings, flew out of China, and started at CoderAcademy.</div>
